# Using a Black Box
To run the program with a custom black box, you need to compile your black box to a .exe format, 
  then when you start the program, you can select your own .exe black box on the Researcher Menu.

The current Blackbox.exe is a compiled version of SDASteerSample, as included in the 
  [SDALib repository](https://github.com/red-panda-productions/SDALib).
  This black box requires the [IPCLib](https://github.com/red-panda-productions/ipc-lib) dll to run, which is why this 
  file is included in this folder as well.
