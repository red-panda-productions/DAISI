                <br/><h2>1. About Speed Dreams in general.</h2>

                <h3><a name="c1_1">1.1 What is Speed Dreams ?</a></h3>
                <p>
          <a href="http://speed-dreams.sourceforge.net" target="_parent">Speed Dreams</a>, <b>an Open Motorsport Sim</b>,
          is a motorsport simulation, which allows you to drive in races against AI opponents (simulated by
                  the computer). You can also develop your own computer-controlled driver (also called a robot) in
                  C or C++ (or even in Delphi, as <a href="http://?????">Wolf-Dieter Beelitz</a>). 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Speed Dreams is "Open Source" (GNU General Public License Version 2 or later).
                </p>

                <h3><a name="c1_2">1.2 Who develops Speed Dreams ?</a></h3>
                <p>
          The Speed Dreams project was forked from <a href="http://www.torcs.org" target="_parent">TORCS</a>
                  in late 2008 by Xavier Bertaux and Jean-Philippe Meuret in order to deliver
                  a better end-user experience through new and visually improved tracks,
                  new cars sets with more realistic handling and improved liveries,
                  more challenging AI opponents, and many other exciting new features to come soon (network, force feedback, career mode ...).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some long time TORCS-addicted developers and artists immediately joined them in the core developers team : 
                  Andrew Sumner, Brian Gavin, Eckhard Jager, Mart Kelder and Wolf-Dieter Beelitz,
                  quickly followed by Gabor Kmetyko and Haruna Say.
                  Christos Dimitrakakis, Sebastian Heni and Kristof Kaly-Kullai also contribute a lot.
                  Visit the official <a href="http://speed-dreams.sourceforge.net" target="_parent">Speed Dreams site</a>, the under-construction <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/speed-dreams">SF.net Wiki</a> and the in-game credits pages for more information, .
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the development team, <b>democracy</b> is the rule : we try and take time
                  to discuss about everything and decide together what and how we work for the project.
                  But we also believe in freeness and responsability : once things are clear,
                  one or multiple members often get the mission to achieve what's been decided,
                  based on their will, skills, interest on the mission, and trust from the team.
                </p>


                <h3><a name="c1_3">1.3 Is documentation available ?</a></h3>
                <p>
                  Yes, there is some documentation available. Look at the official
                  <a href="http://speed-dreams.sourceforge.net" target="_parent">Speed Dreams site</a> and on
                  the under-construction <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/speed-dreams">SF.net Wiki</a>. 
                  You can find installation instructions <a href="http://speed-dreams.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/speed-dreams/trunk/INSTALL?view=markup">here</a>,
                  the TORCS robot tutorial <a href="http://www.torcs.org">here</a>,
                  instructions about how to use Speed Dreams <a href="http://???/how_to_driver.html">here</a>. 
                  A very brief track howto is available
                  <a href="http://www.idiap.ch/~dimitrak/torcs/track-howto.html" target="_parent">here</a>,
                  there is as well a <a href="http://katergo.rege.org/projects/trackeditor" target="_parent">track editor</a> available,
                  and Andrew Sumner is currently creating a <a href="http://???">car building tutorial</a>.
                </p>

                <h3><a name="c1_4">1.4 Which features has Speed Dreams ?</a></h3>
                <p>
                  There are 4 different car sets featuring a total of 28 cars, AI opponents for nearly all of these (except for the LS-GT1 car set : WIP) and 38 tracks to race on.
                  You can steer with a joystick, a gamepad or a steering wheel with pedals, if it's supported by your platform.
                  It is also possible to drive with the mouse or the keyboard, but it's not easy. Graphic features
                  lighting, smoke, exhaust flames, skidmarks and glowing brake disks. The simulation features a simple damage
                  model, collisions, tire and wheel properties
          (springs, dampers, stiffness, ...), aerodynamics (ground effect, spoilers, ...) and much more.
                  The gameplay allows different types of races from the simple practice session up to the championship (and soon a full racer life-time career mode).
                  Enjoy racing against your friends in the split screen mode with up to four human players.
                </p>

                <h3><a name="c1_5">1.5 What are the future plans ?</a></h3>
                <p>
                  Besides maintenance and bugfixing, the develoment team is currently working
                  on network gaming, racer life-time career mode, full weather simulation, improved engine sound, new tracks ; 
                  force feedback, new car sets with AI opponents will also be there for the next release (2.0) ;
                  improved physics, better inside view, replay, improved graphic rendering, improved performances are also domains in which we'll be working in the mid-term.
                </p>

                <h3><a name="c1_6">1.6 Why don't you ... ?</a></h3>
                <p>
                  Don't ever forget that we develop Speed Dreams in our spare time and you get it for free. Your wishes,
                  ideas and feature requests are welcome in the
                  <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/speed-dreams-users" target="_parent">
                  speed-dreams-users</a> mailing list or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/speed-dreams">tracker</a>. If nobody picks up your idea feel free to contact the development team :
                  we'll be happy to help you implement it yourself ;-)
                </p>

                <h3><a name="c1_7">1.7 What do you mean with robot ?</a></h3>
                <p>
                  In Speed Dreams a "robot" is a piece of program code that automatically drives a car,
                  so all the opponents you choose are robots. Aka "AI" opponents (Artificial Intelligence).
                </p>

                <h3><a name="c1_8">1.8 Why don't you replace GLUT with SDL ?</a></h3>
                
                <p>
                  We actually are doing so : next release will no more use GLUT.
                </p>

                <h3><a name="c1_9">1.9 Why don't you replace PLib with OGRE 3D / OSG ?</a></h3>
                
                <p>
                  We are currently thinking about starting to move that way ;
                  but we have to rewrite the whole 3D graphics module from scratch ...
                  so it will probably take some time. Fortunately, the modular architecture of the code
                  we inherited from TORCS enables us to achieve it smoothly : expect some preview soon.
                </p>

                        Yes, you can find offline robot championships in the 
                        <a href="http://www.berniw.org/trb" target="_parent">TORCS Racing Board</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                        This championship is actually dedicated to TORCS-compatible robots
                        but Speed Dreams offers backward compatibility with TORCS as for this :
                        your TORCS robot will work as is in Speed Dreams, and your Speed Dreams robot
                        will work in TORCS if you follow some very simple rules (contact the dev. team for more details).
                </p>


                <h3><a name="c1_11">1.11 Should I start my own racing sim project ?</a></h3>
                <p>
                        Definitively not, no! Why ? Do a search on sf.net and Google,
                        you will find between 15 and 40 open source car/driving/racing sim
                        projects, and most of them have been &quot;promising&quot; and
                        died. Instead of starting another dead project contribute to the
                        few existing successful ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Believe it or not, but your project will very likely be a dead
                        one as well. The reason is quite simple, people underestimate the
                        required effort and the change of their lives during the project lifespan, think
                        about it. Just that you get an idea, TORCS turns now 12 ...
                </p>
                <p>
                        Of course, you will say  : "this is a strange advice, from you guys, who recently forked
                        from TORCS ...". Yes, true ... and false. Because if TORCS had been that open
                        to our ideas and working will, certainly we had joined its dev. team ...
                        but most of us have been proposing so much valuable work for such a long time
                        without seeing it actually integrated ... that we finally come to that extreme conclusion.
                </p>
                <p>
                        And believe it or not, we promise here we won't do this TORCS error twice :
                        from the beginning, we stated that everything in the project would be
                        decided on a <b>democratic</b> basis inside the development team.
                        And that we'd be happy to welcome good candidates in the team provided
                        they accept this democracy statement and the main purpose of the project :
                        deliver a game for the sim driving and racing addicts.
                </p>


                <br/><h2>2. Platforms and Requirements.</h2>

                <h3><a name="c2_1">2.1 On which operating systems does Speed Dreams run?</a></h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Linux (x86 and x86_64) on several distros (Mandriva 2008, 9, 10 ; Ubuntu 9.x), with GCC 4.x compiler</li>
                  <li>Windows XP, Vista, 7, with MS Visual C++ 2005/2008 compiler</li>
                </ul>
                  The Mac OS X port is 95% finished, with the CMake build system : Volonteers are welcome for the last 5%, and make it available for the next release ;-).
                </p>
                <p>
                  And TORCS was known to work also on PPC Linux, FreeBSD and Windows 98/2000, so it should not be complicated to port Speed Dreams to these platforms if needed. Please report of any try !
                </p>

                <h3><a name="c2_2">2.2 What are the hardware requirements ?</a></h3>

                <p>
                  Minimum: 1 GHz CPU, 256 Mb RAM, OpenGL 1.3 compatible graphics card with 32 Mb GRAM.<br/>
                  Recommended: 2 GHz CPU, 512 Mb RAM, OpenGL 1.3 compatible graphics card with 64 Mb GRAM.
                </p>

                <h3><a name="c2_3">2.3 What are the software requirements ?</a></h3>
                <p>
                  You need recent, working and properly configured OpenGL/DRI drivers. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  You need also several 3rd party libraries :
                  <ul>
                    <li>GLUT 3.7 or better FreeGlut</li>
                    <li>PLib 1.8.3, 4 or 5</li>
                    <li>Open AL 1.6.x</li>
                    <li>Free ALUT 1.1</li>
                    <li>ZLib</li>
                    <li>LibJPEG</li>
                    <li>LibPNG</li>
                  </ul>
                  <b>Important:</b> You'll find ready to use MS VC 2005 SP1 Windows binaries for these libs
                  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=239111" target="_parent">here</a>
                  (along with other libs we use for future developments) as well as the associated sources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Note: Under x86_64 Linux, you need to set the <b>&quot;-fPIC&quot;</b> compiler switch when
                  compiling PLib (export CFLAGS=&quot;-fPIC&quot;, export CPPFLAGS=&quot;-fPIC&quot;, 
                  export CXXFLAGS=&quot;-fPIC&quot;). 
                  Under Windows, make sure you compile all the 3rd party libraries using
                  the <b>&quot;Multi-threaded DLL&quot;</b> run-time C library.
                </p>

                  you will experience this error (NVidia removed those definitions...). 
                  To fix it, you need to install a gl.h which defines the missing symbols.

                <h4><a name="c4_3_9">4.3.9 Speed Dreams does not start and reports slDSP:.</a></h4>
                <p>
                  Make sure that the sound device is available for Speed Dreams and you use the latest drivers. Perhaps you
                  have a sound daemon
                  running in the background and you need to start Speed Dreams with a wrapper (e. g. artsdsp of KDE)
                  or to disable the daemon.
                </p>

                <h4><a name="c4_3_10">4.3.10 The cars are flickering.</a></h4>
                <p>
                  Probably your depth buffer has just 16 bit, you should have seen a hint at Speed Dreams startup.
                  Try to run your X-server at 24 or 32 bpp, or update/replace your OpenGL/DRI drivers. In
                  Windows set the quality in the OpenGL properties tab to maximum, such that Speed Dreams has a chance
                  to get a 24 bit depth buffer.
                </p>

                <h4><a name="c4_3_11">4.3.11 I use ALSA and Speed Dreams does not start up.</a></h4>
                <p>
                  You get an error message similar to this:
                </p>

                <pre>slDSP: getBufferInfo: Broken pipe.</pre>

                <p>
                  Altough the sound works with the other applications, you have messed up your ALSA installation.
                  Make sure that the versions of your ALSA driver, libraries, tools and utilities are matching.
                  This can especially happen if you run a self-compiled kernel.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you use the open Mesa/DRI drivers, update your OpenGL/DRI drivers and try FreeGLUT.
                  It seems to be a bug in the visual matching code of GLUT or OpenGL/DRI.
                  The output of 'glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"' should report at least "1.2 Mesa 5.0.1".

                <p>
                  You have probably more than one GLU library installed on your system and Speed Dreams is linked with
                  a version that does not match the version defined in the header files. Remove all old GLU libraries,
                  make sure that the header files are matching with the library. Make also sure that you have recent
                  OpenGL headers installed which define the GL_UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8 symbol, then recompile Speed Dreams.

                <p>
                  This is probably an OpenGL setup problem, check your installation with bzflag and tuxcart. You have to
                  reinstall the XFree86 libraries, FreeGLUT and your OpenGL drivers.

                <p>
                  You have probably two OpenAL libraries installed on your system and Speed Dreams has been linked
                  to one, and uses another one at run-time (when starting a race). 
                  Fix this issue in your build environment (CXX/CPP/LD_FLAGS) and / or run-time one (LD_LIBRARY_PATH).
                  Now recomplie and reinstall Speed Dreams.

                <h3><a name="c4_4">4.4 Other Problems.</a></h3>

                <h4><a name="c4_4_1">4.4.1 How do I capture a movie ?</a></h4>
                <p>
                  First, you have to configure the video capturing in config/raceengine.xml. The captured frames
                  are stored in the output directory, so you need to have write permission and plenty of
                  space (~ 1GB for one minute, depends on framerate and resolution).
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the simulation, you can hit "c" to start and stop the capture. The frames are
                  stored in the output directory and named this way: torcs-ssss-ffffffff.png, ssss is
                  the sequence number and ffffffff the frame number in the sequence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now you need a tool to compose the frames to a movie. If you use mencoder (of the mplayer 0.92)
                  you have first to convert the images to jpg's with the png2jpg tool from src/misc/png2jpg.
                  Now encode the video with mencoder -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:vhq:vbitrate=1800 &#92;*.jpg -mf on:fps=25.
                </p>

                <h4><a name="c4_4_2">4.4.2 Can I develop a robot using Windows ?</a></h4>
                <p>
                  Yes, you can. Here is a rough guide:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Download the Speed Dreams source and manage to compile and run it.</li>
                  <li>Download e. g. the bt robot package, it is a little enhanced version of
              the robot developed in the tutorial, so there is good documentation available
              to understand it.</li>
                  <li>Copy the sources into a new directory, e. g. when you choose the name "myrobot"
              create a directory /src/drivers/myrobot.</li>
                  <li>Copy all the bt files into the myrobot directory.</li>
                  <li>Now rename all "bt*" files into "myrobot*".</li>
                  <li>Edit myrobot.def and also change all bt strings into myrobot.</li>
                  <li>The same for myrobot.dsp, .xml, perhaps more, you get the idea.</li>
                  <li>Change the "bt" module entry point in myrobot.cpp to "myrobot", also make
                          the strings for the robots names and description match with those in myrobot.xml.</li>
                  <li>Add the myrobot project to Speed Dreams, open the project with vc++ and try to compile it.</li>
                  <li>If you want to deploy the files you have to do that manually, create a
                          directory in "runtime" where the other robots are and copy the required files
              there (myrobot.dll, .xml, setup subdirectories etc.).</li>
                  <li>Now Speed Dreams should pick up your robot.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><a name="c4_4_3">4.4.3 Is my joystick / steering wheel / gamepad supported ?</a></h4>
                <p>
                  If your operating system supports your device, it will also work within Speed Dreams. To learn how
                  to setup your input device visit the Speed Dreams site and read the "How to drive" section
                  or read out the how_to_drive.html document shipped with the game.
                </p>


                <h4><a name="c4_4_4">4.4.4 How do I set up a multiplayer game ?</a></h4>
                <p>
                  Speed Dreams supports split screen multiplayer games with up to four players. Setup:
                  <ul>
                        <li>Set up the players in the "Configure Players" screen.</li>
                        <li>If more than one player uses the keyboard, read <a href="http://www.sjbaker.org/steve/omniv/keyboards_are_evil.html" target="_parent">this</a>.</li>
                        <li>Now choose a race, select the players in the configuration screen.</li>
                        <li>Start the race, stop it with "p" to pause.</li>
                        <li>Now create the split screens with "]", or remove them with "[".</li>
                        <li>If you want to change the view of a "mini screen" point with the mouse on it and set it up as usual (F1-F11, "&gt;", "&lt;", ...).</li>
                        <li>When you have set up all views press "p" to end the pause and start the race.</li>
                        <li>Have fun;-)</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>


                <h4><a name="c4_4_5">4.4.5 I can't adjust the joystick / wheel / gamepad axis centering.</a></h4>
                <p>
                        Before you start Speed Dreams, make sure that the joystick / wheel / gamepad
                        is correctly setup/calibrated for your system. You can use the "jscal" and "jstest"
                        utilities for that ; you should find them in your Linux distribution
                        or from the Linux Console project on the internet.
                        If this works fine, center your axis (e.g. if you have noncentering axis like sliders),
                        then startup Speed Dreams and setup your players and controls configuration.
                        It is important to center the axis before you go to the calibration (Question: is it still relevant ?).
                </p>
