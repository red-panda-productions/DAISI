.SH DESCRIPTION
Speed Dreams is a Motorsport Simulator featuring high-quality 3D graphics
and an accurate physics engine, all targeting maximum realism.
Initially forked from TORCS, it has now reached a clearly higher realism level
in visual and physics simulation, thanks to its active development team
and growing community.
It mainly aims to implement exciting new features, cars, tracks and AI opponents
to make a more enjoyable game for the player, while constantly pushing forward
visual and physics realism. 
It is also intended for any research, study or teaching activity, around physics and AI,
thanks to its GPL V2+ license, and the clear and modular architecture
of its C/C++ code base.
As everything is open in Speed Dreams, you can also tweak you favorite car physics setup,
create a band new car model, or simply design a new shinning livery for an existing one,
and even create an entire new track with its landscape, or simply improve an existing one.
And even more ...
