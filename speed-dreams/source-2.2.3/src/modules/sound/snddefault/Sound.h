/** A generic sound.  The aim is to have a more or less
 * identical interface to sounds, no matter what the backend is. In
 * practice, there are some minor differences across interfaces. In
 * particular, for Plib sounds, setting pitch and volume actually sets
 * the pitch/volume of the sound that we are listening at, while for
 * Openal sounds, it sets only the pitch/volume of the source
 * sound. Thus, the interface is not consistent across
 * backends. Making it consistent is not easily doable because some
 * things simply work too differently. Currently I have traded
 * complexity in Sound for replicating some code in the two
 * SoundInterface implementations: OpenalSoundInterface and
 * PlibSoundInterface both take into account the individual
 * pecularities of each PlibSound and OpenalSound. However,
 * if it is deemed necessary later on, it is possible to make the
 * interface consistent.
