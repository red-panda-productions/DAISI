This directory contains a mixture of files, sourced from different places.

Previously the files used were sourced from Apache.org (I believe) and 
licensed as MPL, which is incompatible with the GPL.

So I have replaced these with files pulled shortly after expat changed 
its license (as per copying-expat.txt). There files are very similar to the
MPL files and the library appears to function in the same manner.

The following files were pulled from:
http://expat.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/expat/expat/?hideattic=0&pathrev=V20000512

ascii.h

'xmlparse.h' was slightly modified in order its exported symbols have a DLL interface
under Windows / MSVC (limited to the XMLPARSEAPI define).

'nametab.h' was sourced from:
http://expat.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/expat/expat/lib/nametab.h?view=log&hideattic=0&pathrev=MAIN

The remainder of the files (xml.h, xml.cpp and build files) are SpeedDreams written 
and are GPL'ed licensed.
