/// @brief Inverts a test. ONLY INTENDED FOR calling with functions provided in this header file, and only with p_comparisonType equal to true. \n
/// Since these comparisons have many tests, a couple naive methods of inverting don't work: \n
/// introducing a variable that switchers every EQ with NE and vice versa; would require inequality of all values, \n
/// EXPECT_(NON)FATAL_FAILURE; expects a single failure, \n
/// chaining EXPECT_NONFATAL_FAILURE with the above; fails if there is just one failure
/// @note Scoped so the reporter is not useable outside of this inversion
/// @note Strictly speaking will not invert a test with p_comparisonType == COMP_UTIL_POINTER_INEQUALITY fully, as having a single pointer equal would already fail the inner test
/// (and thus succeed) \n but calling INVERT_COMP_TEST with an inner call with p_comparisonType == COMP_UTIL_POINTER_INEQUALITY is not the intended use case
/// @note Based on this answer on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/a/68331825
