/****
* NAME
*   netChat - network chat class
*
* DESCRIPTION
*   This class adds support for 'chat' style protocols -
*   where one side sends a 'command', and the other sends
*   a response (examples would be the common internet
*   protocols - smtp, nntp, ftp, etc..).
*
*   The handle_buffer_read() method looks at the input
*   stream for the current 'terminator' (usually '\r\n'
*   for single-line responses, '\r\n.\r\n' for multi-line
*   output), calling found_terminator() on its receipt.
*
* EXAMPLE
*   Say you build an nntp client using this class.
*   At the start of the connection, you'll have
*   terminator set to '\r\n', in order to process
*   the single-line greeting.  Just before issuing a
*   'LIST' command you'll set it to '\r\n.\r\n'.
*   The output of the LIST command will be accumulated
*   (using your own 'collect_incoming_data' method)
*   up to the terminator, and then control will be
*   returned to you - by calling your found_terminator()
*
* AUTHORS
*   Sam Rushing <rushing@nightmare.com> - original version for Medusa
*   Dave McClurg <dpm@efn.org> - modified for use in PLIB
*
* CREATION DATE
*   Dec-2000
